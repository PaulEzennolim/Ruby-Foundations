# Ruby Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of Ruby exercises and a final project organized into weekly themes, each addressing specific concepts fundamental to programming in Ruby.

## Project Structure

### `week-01-basics`
Basic Ruby scripts covering printing, input handling, calculations, and simple age-related computations.

### `week-02-conditionals`
Ruby scripts focusing on conditional logic including booleans, conditional statements (`if`, `elsif`, logical operators), methods with arguments, and a text adventure.

### `week-03-logic-methods`
Exercises on logical decision-making, such as determining even/odd numbers, leap years, identifying maximum values, profit or loss calculation, and a simple US voting system.

### `week-04-loops`
Scripts demonstrating loop constructs (`for`, `while`), loop control (`break` and `continue`), and arrays in Ruby.

### `week-05-games`
Fun and interactive scripts including ASCII art generation, FizzBuzz challenge, a guessing game, prime number checking, and reversing user input.

### `week-06-final-project`
Comprehensive final project: A Word Guessing Game demonstrating Ruby skills learned across all weeks.
